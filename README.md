# Confluence
Confluence is a news feed aggregator. It collects RSS feeds from various news websites and sorts the articles in them on the basis of importance and the userâ€™s preferences. It focuses on user keyword matching, but also uses clustering to sort the accumulated RSS feeds on the basis of repetition of keywords. In this section you will find the scope and the targeted audience.
